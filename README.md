# genedateR
R code to detect gene names converted to dates in Excel

The code basically finds numbers stored as text in Excel sheets that are in a range that would convert to a date in the last ~30 years

This does show up a lot of false positives - it turns out a lot of people store numbers as text in Excel sheets - but it also finds the true posititives :-)
